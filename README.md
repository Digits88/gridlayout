[GridLayout](https://ghinda.net/gridlayout/) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ghinda/gridlayout.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ghinda/gridlayout)
============

Lightweight grid system for advanced horizontal and vertical app layouts, with support for older browsers.

Installation
------------

```
npm install gridlayout
```

or

```
bower install gridlayout
```

Why use GridLayout?
-------------------

If you need to create advanced app layouts, similar to native app layouts, but still need to support older browsers, GridLayout is for you.

If you just support modern browsers, youâ€™re probably better off using Flexbox.

GridLayout is built using `display: table`.

Features
--------

* Responsive - Mobile first and adapts to two other breakpoints.
* Familiar markup - Class naming similar to the Bootstrap grid.
* Vertical grids - Take up the entire height of the container and split it.
* Vertical alignment - Align cell content vertically with just a class.
* Scrollview - Scroll the content inside one of the grid cells.

Browser support
---------------

* IE 8+
* iOS 5+
* Android 3+
* Modern browsers

Browsers that support the overall grid, but not the scrollview:

* Opera Mini
* iOS 4
* Android 2

**Note:**

For overall IE support you have to include the `gridlayout-ie.js` script.

For IE8, also include [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond), because the grid is mobile-first.
